#Simple Form Gem   â™¥

By [Plataformatec](http://plataformatec.com.br/).

**SimpleForm** is an easy way to integrate forms with style and all the components on your app.  

Basically it's a stack of components that are invoked to create a complete html input for you, which by default contains; labels , hints, errors and the input itself.

**Simple Form** maps your input type (retrieved from the column definition in the database) to a specific helper method.

##Installing the gem : 
On your app, go to your gem file and type the following : 
```ruby
gem 'simple_form'
```

Run the following command on your terminal to install it:

```console
bundle install
```

Run the generator also in your terminal:

```console
rails generate simple_form:install
```
